# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-15

### 🚀 New Features

#### Expanded Platform Support
- **New Transfer Targets:**
  Added direct context transfer support for two additional AI platforms:
  - **DeepSeek**
  - **Perplexity**
- **Auto-Fill Integration:**
  Context can now be injected directly into DeepSeek and Perplexity input fields using the same one-click transfer flow as other supported platforms.

#### API Integration (DeepSeek / Perplexity)
- **Native API Calls:**
  Added first-class API request support for:
  - **DeepSeek API**
  - **Perplexity API**
- **Unified Request Layer:**
  Both APIs are now handled through the same normalized request pipeline used by existing providers, ensuring consistent behavior and error handling.
- **BYO Key Compatible:**
  Fully compatible with the existing **Bring Your Own Key** architecture. API keys remain client-side only.

---

  Added a stable **QR Code** feature for cross-device context sharing.
  - Supports Basket-only, Page-only, and Merged Context exports.
  - Optimized payload structure for faster mobile scanning and decoding.
- **Source-Aware Transfer:**
  QR payloads now include **context source metadata**, allowing receivers to clearly identify where each context block originates.

#### Context Source Annotation
- **Explicit Source Labels:**
  All captured context blocks are now automatically annotated with their origin:
  - Page Selection
  - Basket Item
  - Manual / Custom Context
- **Export Consistency:**
  Source annotations are preserved across all output paths (Auto-Fill, Copy, QR Code, Export).

---

### 🧠 Core Context Architecture

#### Context Output Normalization
- **Unified Output Schema:**
  All context outputs now follow a single, consistent structure regardless of entry point.
- **Eliminated Format Drift:**
  Removed legacy inconsistencies between Panel, Drone Mode, and Auto-Fill pipelines.
- **Deterministic Ordering:**
  Context ordering is now predictable and optimized for long-context stability in LLMs.

  Simplified the entire UI by replacing text-heavy buttons with clear, icon-based actions.
- **Cross-Mode Consistency:**
  Unified icon semantics across Main Panel, Drone Mode, and PiP windows.
- **Reduced Visual Noise:**
  Removed redundant labels and secondary text for faster visual scanning.

#### Visual Consistency Pass
- **Layout Simplification:**

## [1.6.3] - 2026-01-06

### 🚀 New Features

#### Drone Mode Enhancements
- **Context Anchors (Pin):**
  Added a **"Pin"** button in Drone Mode. Users can now mark their current scroll position in long conversation logs and instantly jump back to the anchor, solving the "lost in context" problem.

  Temporarily hidden the **PDF (Direct Download)** option due to underlying library instability. Users can still use **PDF (Print View)** for reliable exporting.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Boundary Condition Crashes:**
  Resolved critical logic errors that caused the extension to crash when hitting specific boundary conditions (e.g., usage limits or empty state handling).
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Added a filter bar in both the Drone and PiP windows to view basket items by specific tags.

#### Universal Export & PDF
- **PDF Support:**
  Added **PDF (Print View)** to the export options, rendering basket content into a clean, printable format.
- **Import/Export Basket:**
  Users can now export the entire basket state or import external datasets into the current session.

### 🛠️ Improvements

- **Task Queue Engine:**
  Implemented `AI_QUEUE` to manage concurrent AI requests and prevent browser throttling when running complex multi-node flows.
- **Loop Control:**
  Added iteration controls (Run 1x, 2x... 10x) allowing workflows to self-loop for iterative refinement or bulk generation.

### 🔒 Privacy & Security

#### "Bring Your Own Key" (BYO Key) Gate
- **Unlock Protocol:**
  Implemented a strict **Feature Unlock** modal that explicitly informs users about the "Client-Side Only" architecture and local storage of API keys before enabling AI features.
- **Safety Checks:**
  Added validation logic for API Keys (checking prefixes like `sk-` for OpenAI/Anthropic) to prevent configuration errors.

### 🛠️ Improvements

- **Local LLM Robustness:**
  - Expanded `manifest.json` host permissions to support a wide range of local development ports (`11434`, `1234`, `8080`, `5000`, `7860`, `3000`) for tools like Ollama, LM Studio, and LocalAI.
  - Improved the `GET_OLLAMA_MODELS` action in `background.js` to intelligently fallback between `/api/tags` and `/v1/models` endpoints for better compatibility.
